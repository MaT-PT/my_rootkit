Add hooks for readv, writev, preadv, pwritev, preadv2, pwritev2
Check early error returns from system calls
Create macros for conditional printing (pr_debug/pr_devel)
Prevent rootkit from being loaded multiple times (hook an internal function, maybe kill or open?, or (f)init_module, or /proc/sys/version read() IOCTL with data in buffer)
Use other mechanisms to send signals/requests to rootkit
Hide network connections/ports
Hide processes whose name start with the hidden prefix, and let them bypass the rootkit by default
Hide children of hidden processes
